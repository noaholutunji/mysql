# Weather Observation Station 19

Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d)  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

The STATION table is described as follows:
