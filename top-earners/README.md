# Top Earners

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary X months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as space-separated integers.

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:
